In this project, we take a dive into two CSV files relating to top Apps in Google Playstore relating to various devices. We clean the data, do an exploratory analysis, identify key variables such as Apps/Reviews/Ratings and Top Categories in order to help our client understand what differentiates popular apps from those that aren't. We end this with a dashboard visualizing the key findings of our analysis.
