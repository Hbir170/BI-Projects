# BI Projects
In this section, I showcase my ability to not only grab insights but visualize them and tell the entire story of the data to the potential client or viewer. I enjoy the storytelling aspect of data analysis just as much as deriving the insights, it's the ability to
break down what made me curious about the data, find the insights I believe answer the questions we have and break them down to a person with no prior knowledge of the data whilst maintaining their interest. 

## Google Playlist Dashboard
This dashboard looks into the Google Playlist datasets provided and the end result is a dashbord that allows the potential client to understand how to launch their product, what categories to avoid, which ones bring the most revenue potential and beyond.

## HR Dashboard
The end result is a PowerBI dashboard which allows you to clearly see what the average person working in this company is like, their age, their likely department, their average tenure within the company, race and many more important details which can help the 
company better understand their path for employee growth and highlight areas of improvement.
